# Love-Calculator
Our project gives you a percentage of love compatibility; the result depends on entries(date of birth)

The product is made to calculate the compatibility between people according to their dates of birth (compatibility) and for the selection of the ideal partner (Perfect Match). Also, a user has an opportunity to share the results in the social network VKontakte. Another feature of our project is that we use in the calculation database pairs collected from VK using its API.

To run the program these NuGet packages have to be installed:
1. HtmlAgilityPack
2. Newtonsoft.Json
3. VkNet
